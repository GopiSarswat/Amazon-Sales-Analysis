ðŸš€ SQL Project: Analyzing Price Trends in Amazon Products ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡

I recently completed an exciting SQL project where I analyzed price trends across various product categories in the Amazon dataset. The goal was to identify products with significant price increases over the past few months, which can help businesses make more informed decisions about pricing strategies.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
Objective: Track the price changes of Amazon products and identify those that have experienced a price increase of more than 20% in the last 6 months.
Key Insights: The project helped uncover overpriced products that might need a closer look, either for potential pricing adjustments or better market positioning.
SQL Techniques Used:
Subqueries to pull historical pricing data for each product
DATEADD and DATEDIFF functions to filter prices based on the last 6 months
Conditional statements to identify significant price increases
Sorting and filtering to prioritize products with the largest price differences
ðŸ’¼ Why It Matters:
Pricing Strategy: Businesses can evaluate whether their products are priced competitively compared to the market, especially when price changes are abrupt.
Market Insight: Helps businesses identify whether their product pricing aligns with market trends or requires adjustments to remain attractive to customers.
Competitive Advantage: With proper pricing, Amazon sellers can improve customer satisfaction and sales, ensuring their products stay competitive in the marketplace.
This project allowed me to enhance my SQL skills, particularly with date functions, aggregations, and subqueries, while diving deeper into real-world data from Amazon. I'm excited to continue applying these insights in future projects to drive more data-driven decisions.
